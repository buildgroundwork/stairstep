    You must run this script from within the git repository you plan to deploy from.
    If you do not specify a deploy commit it will try to deploy HEAD.

    You must have installed the heroku executable and authorized with Heroku.
    Run `heroku login` if you have not yet authorized with Heroku.

    This script will, by default, precompile assets, package gems, and create a
    commit for the results of each.  You may disable either or both actions by
    specifying options (see below).

    This script will also, by default, generate an annotated tag for the deploy,
    and push the tag to the `origin` remote.  You may also disable this behavior.
